/// This protocol is used to create different content areas on the screen.
///
/// On-screen ``Scene``s are the building blocks of any app built entirely in SwiftUI. They can look
/// different depending on the platform the app is running on. For example, in iOS, the screen usually
/// only displays one scene at a time. In macOS, every window in an app might be a different scene.
///
/// Scenes can either be custom, or one of the primitives like ``WindowGroup`` or
/// ``DocumentGroup``.
///
/// ### Creating a Scene
///
/// #### Using primitive Scenes
///
/// Primitive scenes like `WindowGroup` can go directly in the body of your ``App``.
///
///     @main
///     struct SuperSimpleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("This is an entire app! üôå")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A white view that displays the text ""This is an entire app! üôå""](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Scene-example-1.png)
///
/// #### Using custom Scenes
///
/// Just like how custom ``View``s are made out of a `var body` of smaller  ``View``s,
/// custom ``Scene``s are made out of a `var body` of smaller ``Scene``s.
///
///     @main
///     struct MacCompatibleApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             CustomScene()
///         }
///
///     struct CustomScene: Scene {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text("This is a mac-compatible app! üíª")
///             }
///
///             #if os(macOS)
///             Settings {
///                 SettingsView()
///             }
///             #endif
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A white view that displays the text "This is a mac-compatible app! üíª"](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Scene-example-2.png)
///
/// ### Modifiers
///
/// Just like how ``View``s have a bunch of custom modifiers that work right out of the box,
/// ``Scene`` provides default implementations of many useful modifiers. These can be used to do things
/// like adding macOS commands, changing the toolbar, and adding support for app storage.
/// [scene-phase ->]
/// ### Getting Scene Status
///
/// The ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase`` environment value can easily be read in a scene
/// to respond to whether the scene is active or in another state. It returns an enumeration of type
/// ``ScenePhase``.
///
///     struct StateAdaptingScene: Scene {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 Text(scenePhase == .active ? "Active!" : "Inactive")
///             }
///         }
///     }

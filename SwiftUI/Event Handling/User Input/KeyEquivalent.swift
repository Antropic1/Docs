/// Key equivalents consist of a letter, punctuation, or function key that can
/// be combined with an optional set of modifier keys to specify a keyboard
/// shortcut.
///
/// Key equivalents are used to establish keyboard shortcuts to app
/// functionality. Any key can be used as a key equivalent as long as pressing
/// it produces a single character value. Key equivalents are typically
/// initialized using a single-character string literal, with constants for
/// unprintable or hard-to-type values.
///
/// The modifier keys necessary to type a key equivalent are factored in to the
/// resulting keyboard shortcut. That is, a key equivalent whose raw value is
/// the capitalized string "A" corresponds with the keyboard shortcut
/// **Command-Shift-A**. The exact mapping may depend on the keyboard layout‚Äîfor
/// example, a key equivalent whith the character value "}" produces a shortcut
/// equivalent to **Command-Shift-]** on ANSI keyboards, but would produce a
/// different shortcut for keyboard layouts where punctuation characters are in
/// different locations.
///

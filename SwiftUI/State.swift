/// A SwiftUI property wrapper that holds a state value.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// Modifying a `@State` variable causes the `body` of the view to be recomputed. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text(foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text") {
///                 foo = "Banana"
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view containing a VStack with a text object derived
/// from a state variable and a button that reads "Change Text";
/// when pressed, the button updates the text through the variable.](wrapped-value-ex.gif)
///
/// In this example, pressing the button labeled "Change Text" modifies the `foo` state variable. This causes `ExampleView`'s `body` to be recomputed by the SwiftUI runtime. This new `body` is then queued for the next render cycle, upon which the view's display is updated on the screen.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - Recomputing the `body` is also frequently referred to as "invalidating the view".
/// - While all SwiftUI views are value types, the `@State` property wrapper creates a reference based storage managed by the SwiftUI runtime. This is why mutating a state variable does not require a mutating function.
///
/// ### Passing state down to a child view
///
/// Pass a state variable just as you would pass any other variable to a struct. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     struct ChildView: View {
///         let text: String
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Text(text)
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             ChildView(text: foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text") {
///                 foo = "Banana"
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view containing a VStack with a text object derived
/// from the child view and a button that reads "Change Text";
/// when pressed, the button updates the text through the state variable.](wrapped-value-ex.gif)
///
/// In this example, `foo` is passed to `ChildView` by initializer.
///
/// And exactly as in the previous example, when `foo` updates, so will the
/// `body` of `ExampleView`. When the `body` of `ExampleView` is recomputed, a
/// new instance of `ChildView` is created with the latest value of `foo`
/// (which is now "Banana"). `ChildView` in turn computes its own `body`,
/// which creates a `Text("Banana")`.
///
/// Everytime a ``View`` is invalidated, its `body` is recomputed. Everytime
/// the body is recomputed, all the view's childrens' bodies are also
/// recursively recomputed. Since SwiftUI views are value types, creating
/// and destroying them repeatedly (even hundreds of times a second) does not
/// impact the app's performance.
///
/// ### Passing a reference to the state
///
/// The previous example demonstrated how a state value could be passed from a
/// view to its child. However, for the child to be able to actually modify
/// the parent's state, the parent must pass a **binding** to its child. A
/// binding is a read/write reference to the `@State` variable, and is
/// represented via ``Binding``.
///
/// To create a binding to a state variable, prefix it with a dollar sign `$`.
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "üçåüçå"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(text)
///         TextField("Placeholder", text: $text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view with a text field containg a call to a state
/// variable and textfield reading "Placeholder"; when populated with new text,
/// the text above the text field updates as well.](state-ex3.gif)
///
/// In this example, `TextField` requires a binding in order to read and write
/// to a given value. The `text` state variable is converted to a
/// `Binding<String>` using the dollar sign prefix (`$text`), and then passed
/// to ``TextField`` via its initializer.
///
/// Note: The ``Binding`` type can also be used to create references to
/// `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` and `@StateObject`. It is not
/// unique to `@State`, but rather a general structure that represents a
/// reference to some source of truth.
///
/// ### Modifying a state variable outside of `body`
///
/// It's possible to modify a state variable outside of a view's `body`. For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     @State var foo: String = "Apple"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack {
///             Text(foo)
///
///             Button("Change Text", action: changeText)
///         }
///     }
///
///     func changeText() {
///         foo = "Banana"
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view containing a VStack with a text object that
/// contains a state variable and a button that reads "Change Text";
/// when pressed, the button updates the text by calling to a function, which
/// calls to the state variable.](wrapped-value-ex.gif)
///
/// In this example, the button labeled "Change text" calls the function `changeText`, which modifies `foo`.
///
/// Note:
///
/// - `changeText` is not a `mutating` function. This is because the `@State`
/// property wrapper internally uses a reference based storage managed by the
/// SwiftUI runtime.
/// - Only access a state property from inside the view‚Äôs body, or from methods
/// called by it.
/// - Declare state properties as private, to prevent outside code from
/// accessing them.
/// - Although you should only access the state from inside the body, you
/// can mutate it elsewhere including from any thread.

    ///         var profileButton: some View {

/// An alignment in both axes.
///
/// Use this structure to align a view when it has both a vertical and
/// horizontal degree of freedom.
///
/// ### What is an `Alignment`?
///
/// An alignment is made up of 2 properties:
/// 1. The ``Alignment/vertical`` alignment, of type ``VerticalAlignment``
/// 2. The ``Alignment/horizontal`` alignment, of type ``HorizontalAlignment``
///
/// Each of those axes have their own options and initializers. To
/// create an ``Alignment``, you can set both properties directly
/// using the initializer,
/// or choose one of ``Alignment``'s static properties.
///
/// #### The ``Alignment`` initializer
///
/// You can also create your own alignments from the
/// ``Alignment/init(horizontal:vertical:)`` initializer
///
/// - Note: The
/// clear color is added to expand the view to the entire screen,
/// so that the alignment movement can be seen
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     let alignment = Alignment(horizontal: .center, vertical: .top)
///
///     var body: some View {
///         ZStack(alignment: alignment) {
///             Text("I'm top aligned ü§†")
///             Color.clear
///         }
///     }

/// vertical alignment and the text "I'm top aligned ü§†"; The text
/// is displayed at the top center of the frame.](alignment-initalizer.png)
///
/// #### The ``Alignment`` static properties
///
/// There are 9 out-of-the-box alignments:
/// 1. ``Alignment/topLeading``
/// 2. ``Alignment/top``
/// 3. ``Alignment/topTrailing``
/// 4. ``Alignment/leading``
/// 5. ``Alignment/center``
/// 6. ``Alignment/trailing``
/// 7. ``Alignment/bottomLeading``
/// 8. ``Alignment/bottom``
/// 9. ``Alignment/bottomTrailing``

/// "Move me around ü§†"; The text is displayed in the bottom left corner of

///
/// This structure is used in 4 places:
/// - ``ZStack``, in the initializer
/// - ``View/overlay(_:alignment:)``, in the view modifier
/// - ``View/background(_:alignment:)``, in the view modifier
/// - ``View/frame(width:height:alignment:)``, in the view modifier

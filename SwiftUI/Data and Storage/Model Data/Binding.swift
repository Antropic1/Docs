/// This type handles shared values across views.
///
/// `Binding` is a property wrapper that creates a connection between stored
/// data, and a view that displays and changes that data. It is a **two-way
/// connection** to a source of truth. It is used to both read the latest
/// value, as well as to set a new value. `Binding` defines a **getter**
/// and a **setter** for a value.
///
/// ### Structure of a `Binding`
///
/// A `Binding` is essentially the following structure:
///
/// ```
/// struct Binding<Value> {
///     let get: () -> Value
///     let set: (Value) -> ()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a `Binding` from `@State`
///
/// A `Binding` typically represents a reference to a mutable source of
/// truth - such as `@State`, `@ObservedObject` or a reference-writable keypath
/// of an object. To create a `Binding` from a mutable source of truth,
/// prefix the variable name for the source of truth with a dollar sign (`$`).
///
/// For example, a ``TextField`` can be bound to a state variable:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var text: String = "üçåüçå"
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text(text)
///         TextField("Placeholder", text: $text)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif showing a text field that displays the corresponding placeholder text in the view center until changed.](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-1.gif)
///
/// In the example above, the source of truth is a `@State` variable,
/// named `text`. `text`  represents a
/// [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string),
/// whereas `$text` represents
/// a `Binding<String>`. ``TextField``'s initializer accepts a placeholder
/// [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) and a
/// `Binding<String>`. In this example, `TextField` requires a
/// ``Binding`` to the source of truth as ``TextField`` must be able to
/// *write back* to the `@State` variable (a **mutable** source of truth).
///
/// Recall, a `Binding` is a **two-way connection** to a source of truth.
/// It is used to both read the latest value, as well as to set a new value.
/// In the previous example, the view's initial render will display an
/// editable text of "üçåüçå" on the screen - ``TextField`` reads the current
/// value of the source of truth ``text`` via the  `Binding` `$text`. When
/// the user starts editing, ``TextField`` *writes back* new values to the
/// source of truth `text` via the `Binding`  `$text` once again.
///
/// ### Creating a `Binding` from an ``ObservableObject``
///
/// In this example, the source of truth is an observable object
/// `ExampleModel` - stored in a `@StateObject` owned by `ExampleView`:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @StateObject var viewModel = ExampleModel()
///
///     var text: String {
///         viewModel.isEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle(text, isOn: $viewModel.isEnabled)
///     }
/// }
///
/// class ExampleModel: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var isEnabled: Bool = false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif showing a view with the text "Disabled", which is replaced by "Enabled" when the corresponding toggle on the right side of the frame is clicked.](https://bananadocs-documentation-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Binding-example-2.gif)
///
/// The binding between the model's `isEnabled` variable and a toggle is
/// established using `$viewModel.isEnabled` within `ExampleView`'s body.
/// Note that the dollar sign must prefix the **root** variable, even in the
/// case where a child member is being referenced. `$viewModel.isEnabled`
/// and `viewModel.$isEnabled` are **not** equivalent. The former creates a
/// ``Binding`` to `isEnabled`, whereas the latter unwraps the projected
/// value of the `@Published` property wrapper wrapping `isEnabled`.
///
/// ### Animating Updates via a ``Binding``
///
/// Since a `Binding` is capable of updating a view's state, the state
/// update can be made to animate with ``Binding/animation(_:)``.
/// Usage looks as follows:
///
/// ```
/// $myVariable.animation(.default)
/// ```
///
/// ### Creating a ``Binding`` from a constant
///
/// At times, you may want to pass a fixed value as a `Binding`. This is
/// possible via ``Binding/constant(_:)``, which creates a `Binding`
/// to a fixed value, ignoring any updates from the consumer of the binding.
///
/// Consider ``EnvironmentValues/editMode``, for example. A ``List`` can be
/// forced into active editing by passing a binding to `EditMode.active`.
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State var fruits = ["üçå", "üçè", "üçë"]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             ForEach(fruits, id: \.self) { fruit in
///                 Text(fruit)
///             }
///             .onDelete { offets in
///                 fruits.remove(atOffsets: offets)
///             }
///         }
///         .environment(\.editMode, .constant(.active))
///     }
/// }
/// ```

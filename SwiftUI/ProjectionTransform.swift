/// A projection transform is a type of spacial transformation of an object
/// that can be represented as a 3x3 matrix.
///
/// Use this structure to apply a 3D transformation to a view.
///
/// Conceptually, this structure represents a 3D transformation matrix.
/// Each column of the matrix represents where the unit vector
/// of the original view lands in the transformed view. The **x** unit
/// vector is represented by the left column, the **y** unit vector
/// is represented by the middle column, and the **z** unit vector
/// is represented by the right column.
///
/// - Note: In the majority of circumstances, it is not necessary to use
/// a `ProjectionTransform` or the ``View/projectionEffect(_:)``
/// modifier. This is only necessary when maximum control is required.
/// For most normal use cases, use the following modifiers instead:
///
/// - **Rotation**: ``View/rotationEffect(_:anchor:)``
/// - **Scaling**: ``View/scaleEffect(_:anchor:)-92995``
/// - **Translation**: ``View/offset(_:)``
///
/// ### Making a `ProjectionTransform`
///
/// Constructing a `ProjectionTransform` is most commonly done in
/// one of three ways:
/// - Using a [`CGAffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgaffinetransform)
/// - Using a [`CATransform3D`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catransform3d)
/// - Using ``GeometryEffect/effectValue(size:)``
///
/// See below for an example.
///
/// ### Using a `ProjectionTransform`
///
/// The primary way to use a `ProjectionTransform` is by using the
/// ``View/projectionEffect(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// ```
/// struct UpsideDownTrashCanView: View {
///     let effect = ProjectionTransform(CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: .pi))
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Text("ðŸ—‘")
///             .font(.title)
///             .projectionEffect(effect)
///     }
/// }
/// ```

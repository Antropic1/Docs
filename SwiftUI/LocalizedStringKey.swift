/// The key used to look up a string in a strings file or strings dictionary
/// file.
///
/// To make the text in your app appear as many different languages
/// depending on the user's preference, use this structure in place
/// of [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string).
///
/// Essentially the way localization works is that rather than using
/// strings directly throughout your app, you use this structure instead.
/// This lets you look up string keys which are translated to all
/// the app's supported languages in a .strings file.
///
/// To learn about creating this file and the process of setting up
/// your project for localization, check out these sources:

/// ### Creating a localized string key
///
/// The most straightforward way to create a localized string key is
/// by using its initializer:
///
///     let hello = LocalizedStringKey("Hello")
///
/// You can also create a localized string key from a string literal,
/// but you must specify the type explicitly or else it will be
/// interpreted as a [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string):
///
///     let hello1 = "Hello" //Type String
///     let hello2: LocalizedStringKey = "Hello" //Type LocalizedStringKey
///
/// ### Using a localized string key
///
/// Many views in SwiftUI, like ``Button`` and ``Text``
/// accept localized string keys directly through their initializers by default.
///
///     struct UsingLocalizationView: View {
///         let text: LocalizedStringKey = "Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Button(text) { }
///                 Text(text)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot displaying a button and a text view in a VStack each reading
/// "Hola" followed by a man emoji.](localization-1.png)
///
/// Also, since SwiftUI is localization-first, if you pass a string literal
/// to these initializers, they will be interpreted as localized string keys!
///
///     struct WithStringLiteralView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("This gets localized! üåé")
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot displaying a single text view that reads "¬°Esto se localiza!"
/// the Spanish translation of the text that is passed to the view.](localizedstringkey-2.png)
///
/// However, if your variable is already a string, the initializer will
/// not localize the string:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         let s = "Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 Text(s) //Not localized
///                 Text("Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è") //Localized!
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot displaying two text views in a VStack; the first does not use
/// a localized string key and displays as "Hello" followed by a woman emoji, but
/// the second does use a localized string key and instead displays as "Hola"
/// followed by a man emoji.](localization-3.png)

/// ### Styling Progress Views
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of progress views
/// by creating styles that conform to the ``ProgressViewStyle``
/// protocol. To set a specific style for all progress view instances
/// within a view, use the ``View/progressViewStyle(_:)`` modifier.
/// In the following example, a custom style adds a dark blue shadow
/// to all progress views within the enclosing ``VStack``:
///
///     struct ShadowedProgressViews: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack(spacing: 50) {
///                 ProgressView()
///                 ProgressView(value: 0.75)
///             }
///             .progressViewStyle(DarkBlueShadowProgressViewStyle())
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct DarkBlueShadowProgressViewStyle: ProgressViewStyle {
///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
///             ProgressView(configuration)
///                 .shadow(color: Color(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0.6),

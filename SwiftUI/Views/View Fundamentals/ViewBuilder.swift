/// A property wrapper that lets you build views declaratively.
///
/// `ViewBuilder` is used extensively in SwiftUI to let you create new
/// on-screen views by just listing them out in a trailing closure.
/// It's a **property wrapper** applied to function parameter.
/// Usually, it's just working behind the scenes, so you don't have to
/// worry about it. But, you can also define your own functions
/// that are view builders, and also include them in your own custom views.
///
/// (A view builder is just specific type of
/// [result builder](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html#ID630)
/// that you can use with ``View``s. Check out that link to learn
/// more about using these to write clean code.)
///
/// ### Using a `ViewBuilder` as a trailing closure
///
/// `ViewBuilder` works behind the scenes of many common SwiftUI
/// views - like ``VStack`` and ``HStack``. For example, here
/// is the declaration of ``Group``'s **initializer**:
///
/// ```
/// public init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///     // Implementation here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since that last parameter is a `ViewBuilders`, you can easily create
/// a ``Group`` by passing it a
/// [trailing closure](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102)
/// stacking views:
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Group {
///             Text("I'm in the group üòÅ")
///             Text("Me too ü•Ç")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![1F38B3B4-1BCC-426D-BEB1-D365A09E5C30](1F38B3B4-1BCC-426D-BEB1-D365A09E5C30.png)
///
/// ### Using a `ViewBuilder` as a function
///
/// You can also use `ViewBuilder` as a function. Just tag your
/// function with `@ViewBuilder`, and use it just like you would with a
/// trailing closure:
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Group(content: contentBuilder)
///     }
///
///     @ViewBuilder
///     func contentBuilder() -> some View {
///         Text("This is another way to create a Group üë•")
///         Text("Just stack the views ü•û")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![5464434F-469F-4385-BFBE-C9B38C911F56](5464434F-469F-4385-BFBE-C9B38C911F56.png)
///
/// ### Using a `ViewBuilder` in your own ``View``s
///
/// Exactly like ``Group``, you can also use `ViewBuilder`s in your own custom
/// views. Just tag the parameter of your ``View``'s initializer with
/// `@ViewBuilder`, and anyone using your view will be able to easily
/// pass you views just by listing them.
///
/// In the example below, we use this technique to create a special
/// type of ``Group`` that makes everything green. Note that ``ViewBuilder``s
/// are actually functions, so in order to get the content they contain,
/// you have to call the function. Below, this is done with `content()`.
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         GreenGroup {
///             Text("I am green ü§ë")
///             Text("Hey same üê≤")
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
///
/// struct GreenGroup<Content>: View where Content: View {
///     var views: Content
///
///     init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///         self.views = content()
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Group {
///             views.foregroundColor(.green)
///         }
///     }

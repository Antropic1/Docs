/// A control that performs an action when triggered.
///
/// You create a button by providing an action and a label. The action is either
/// a method or closure property that does something when a user clicks or taps
/// the button. The label is a view that describes the button's action, for
/// example, by showing text such as Cancel or an icon such as a back arrow.
///
///
///     struct SignInView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Button(action: { /*sign the user in*/ }) {
///                 Text("Sign In")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![Button with text reading "Sign in".](button-signin.png)
///
/// For the common case of text-only labels, you can use the convenience
/// initializer that takes a title string (or localized string key) as its first
/// parameter, instead of a trailing closure:
///
///     struct EasySignInView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Sign In", action: { /*sign the user in*/ })
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![Button with text reading "Sign in".](button-signin.png)
///
/// The method of triggering the button varies by platform:
/// - In iOS and watchOS, the user triggers a standard button by tapping on it.
/// - In macOS, the user triggers a standard button by clicking on it.
/// - In tvOS, the user triggers a standard button by pressing "select" on an
///   external remote, like the Siri Remote, while focusing on the button.
///
/// ### Adding Buttons to Containers
///
/// Use buttons for any user interface element that triggers actions on press.
/// Buttons automatically adapt their visual style to match the expected style
/// within these different containers and contexts. For example, to create a
/// list cell that triggers an action when selected by the user, add a button to
/// the list's content. For example:
///
///     struct Item: Identifiable {
///         let id = UUID()
///         let title: String
///     }
///
///     struct ListView: View {
///         let items = [Item(title: "üçå"), Item(title: "üçë")]
///         var body: some View {
///             // A list of items, where the last row, when triggered,
///             // opens a UI for adding a new item.
///             List {
///                 ForEach(items) { item in
///                     Text(item.title)
///                 }
///                 Button("Add Item", action: { /* add item */ } )
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A list with three items, the last of which is a button reading "Add Item".](AddItem.png)
///
/// Similarly, to create a context menu item that triggers an action, add a
/// button to the menu's content:
///
///     struct ContextMenuView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("Press and hold for copy-paste options")
///                 .contextMenu {
///                     Button("Cut", action: { /* cut */ } )
///                     Button("Copy", action: { /* copy */ } )
///                     Button("Paste", action: { /* paste */ } )
///                 }
///         }
///     }
///
///![A gif showing a view containing a button reading "Press and hold for copy-past options"; once the button is clicked, a pop-up containing three buttons, reading "Cut," "Copy," and "Paste", appears.](button-menu-content-ex.gif)
///
/// This pattern extends to most other container views in SwiftUI that have
/// customizable, interactive content, like forms (instances of ``Form``).
///
/// ### Styling Buttons
///
/// You can customize a button's appearance and interaction behavior. To add a
/// custom appearance with standard interaction behavior, create a style that
/// conforms to the ``ButtonStyle`` protocol. To customize both appearance and
/// interaction behavior, create a style that conforms to the
/// ``PrimitiveButtonStyle`` protocol. To set a specific style for all button
/// instances within a view, use the ``View/buttonStyle(_:)-3c92f`` modifier:
///
///     struct ButtonView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             HStack {
///                 Button("Sign In", action: { /* sign in */ } )
///                 Button("Register", action: { /* register */ } )
///             }
///             .buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle())
///         }
///     }
///

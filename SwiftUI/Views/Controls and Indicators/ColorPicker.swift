/// A view that lets the user choose a color.
///
/// The color picker provides a color well that shows the currently selected
/// color, and displays the larger system color picker that allows users to
/// select a new color.
///
/// By default color picker supports colors with opacity; to disable opacity
/// support, set the `supportsOpacity` parameter to `false`.
/// In this mode the color picker won't show controls for adjusting the opacity
/// of the selected color, and strips out opacity from any color set
/// programmatically or selected from the user's system favorites.
///
/// In general, there are 3 types of color picker titles, and 2 binding types,
/// for 6 initializers total.
///
/// Title types:
///
/// 1. [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string)
/// 2. ``LocalizedStringKey``
/// 3. ``View``
///
/// Binding types:
///
/// 1. ``CGColor``
/// 2. ``Color``
///
/// You use ``ColorPicker`` by embedding it inside a view hierarchy and
/// initializing it with a title string and a `Binding` to a ``Color``:
///
///     struct ColorView: View {
///         @State private var color = Color.red
///
///         var body: some View {
///             RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
///                 .fill(color)
///                 .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
///
///             ColorPicker("Choose a color! ðŸŽ¨", selection: $color)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view with a 100 x 100 rounded rectangle with a fill
/// derived from the state variable "color" and a ColorPicker titled
/// "Choose a color! ðŸŽ¨", whose selection input is bound to the state variable;

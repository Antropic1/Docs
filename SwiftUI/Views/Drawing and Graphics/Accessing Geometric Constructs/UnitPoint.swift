/// A dynamic data structure for representing a point in a view.
///
/// ### What is a `UnitPoint`?
///
/// A `UnitPoint` is a 2D coordinate. Its `x` and `y` values are measured
/// from `0.0` to `1.0`, and represent fractions of the parent view.
/// The positive **x-axis** runs from **leading** edge to **trailing** edge, and the positve
/// **y-axis** moves from **top** to **bottom**.
///
/// There are two ways to make a `UnitPoint`:
/// you can either customize the `x` and `y` coordinates, or you can use a
/// predefined constant.
/// SwiftUI has 10 `UnitPoint` constants:
/// 1. ``UnitPoint/zero``
/// 2. ``UnitPoint/center``
/// 3. ``UnitPoint/topleading``
/// 4. ``UnitPoint/top``
/// 5. ``UnitPoint/toptrailing``
/// 6. ``UnitPoint/trailing``
/// 7. ``UnitPoint/bottomtrailing``
/// 8. ``UnitPoint/bottom``
/// 9. ``UnitPoint/bottomleading``
/// 10. ``UnitPoint/leading``
///
/// ### How to use a `UnitPoint`
///
/// `UnitPoints`s can be used to specify the anchor point for view
/// transformations like ``View/rotationEffect(_:anchor:)``
/// and ``View/scaleEffect(_:anchor:)-92995``. They are used commonly in
/// ``Shape``s and gradients.
///
/// For example, a ``LinearGradient`` accepts a `UnitPoint` for the
/// `startPoint` and `endPoint` parameters.
/// This example uses the ``UnitPoint/top`` and ``UnitPoint/bottom``
/// unit points.
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         let colors = [Color.yellow, Color.orange]
///         let gradient = Gradient(colors: colors)
///         let linearGradient = LinearGradient(gradient: gradient,
///                                             startPoint: UnitPoint.top,
///                                             endPoint: UnitPoint.bottom)
///         return Rectangle()
///             .fill(linearGradient)
///             .frame(width:100, height:100)
///     }

/// A radial gradient that draws an ellipse.
///
/// The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square
/// in which its center and radii are defined, then stretches that
/// square to fill its bounding rect, possibly also stretching the
/// circular gradient to have elliptical contours.
///
/// For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the view, filling
/// its bounds:
///
///     EllipticalGradient(gradient: .init(colors: [.red, .yellow]))
///
/// When using an elliptical gradient as a shape style, you can also use
/// ``ShapeStyle/ellipticalGradient(_:center:startRadiusFraction:endRadiusFraction:)-fmox``.

/// A container for grouping controls used for data entry, such as in settings

/// SwiftUI renders forms in a manner appropriate for the platform. For example,

/// parts of a form's content.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     @State private var myFruit = ""
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Form {
///             TextField("Banana üçå", text: $myFruit)
///             TextField("Banana üçå", text: $myFruit)
///             TextField("Banana üçå", text: $myFruit)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```

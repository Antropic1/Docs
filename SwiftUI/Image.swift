/// A view that displays an image.
///
/// Use this view to display an image on screen.
///
/// ### Get Started
///
/// **First**, create an image in your Assets folder.
///
/// ![A screenshot of the XCode Assets folder in which an image of the ocean has
/// been imported.](image-assets.png)
///
/// To follow along, save the following image as `"ocean"` in your project.
///
/// ![Ocean Image](ocean.jpg)
///
/// **Second**, reference the image by name in your code.
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Image("ocean")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A view displaying the ocean image.](image-basic.png)
///
/// **Third**, remember to add the ``Image/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)`` modifier to make your image resizable.
///
/// Add some modifiers to style your image!
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Image("ocean")
///             .resizable()
///             .scaledToFit()
///             .cornerRadius(10)
///             .padding()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A view displaying the resizable ocean image, scaled to fit the view, with
/// a 10 point corner radius, and padding.](ocean-image.png)
///
/// ### Resizing Images
///
/// - Important: The ``Image/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)`` modifier
/// must come first on an Image before making changes to its size in subsequent
/// modifiers.
///
/// The ``View/scaledToFit()`` modifier will lock the aspect ratio of the image
/// and scale it to the maximum size it can be without being too large for the
/// screen.
///
/// The ``View/scaledToFill()`` modifier also scales the image, but it does not
/// lock the aspect ratio and, subsequently, is likely to stretch or shrink the
/// image to fit the available space.
///
/// ### Using system icon images
///
/// SF Symbols is a library of over 1500 symbols that Apple provides in nine
/// weights from ultralight to black. To use these in custom images, simply
/// use the ``Image/init(systemName:)`` initializer.
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Image(systemName: "photo")
///             .resizable()
///             .scaledToFit()
///             .padding()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///

/// scaled to fit the view and has a 10 point corner radius and padding.](1285236D-2F00-4099-8A5A-3CC5E76A5000.png)
///
/// The [SF Symbols Mac app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) makes the
/// symbol names easier to find. SF Symbols helps to maintain a consistent

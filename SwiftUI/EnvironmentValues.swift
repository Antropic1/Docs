/// A collection of environment values propagated through a view hierarchy.
///
/// SwiftUI exposes a collection of values to your app's views in an
/// `EnvironmentValues` structure. To read a value from the structure,
/// declare a property using the ``Environment`` property wrapper and
/// specify the value's key path. For example, you can read the current locale:
///
///     @Environment(\.locale) var locale: Locale
///
/// Use the property you declare to dynamically control a view's layout.
/// SwiftUI automatically sets or updates many environment values, like
/// ``EnvironmentValues/pixelLength``, ``EnvironmentValues/scenePhase``, or
/// ``EnvironmentValues/locale``, based on device characteristics, system state,
/// or user settings. For others, like ``EnvironmentValues/lineLimit``, SwiftUI
/// provides a reasonable default value.
///
/// You can set or override some values using the ``View/environment(_:_:)``
/// view modifier:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("This is some long, multiline text ðŸ’¬, that just keeps going")
///                 .frame(width: 200)
///                 .environment(\.lineLimit, 2)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A white view containing text with a small frame width and an evironment modifier defining a line limit of two; the text displays as "This is some long,\n multiline text ðŸ’¬, that ju...". ](enviornmentvalues-1.png)
///
/// The value that you set affects the environment for the view that you modify
/// --- including its descendants in the view hierarchy --- but only up to the
/// point where you apply a different environment modifier.
///
/// SwiftUI provides dedicated view modifiers for setting some values, which
/// typically makes your code easier to read. For example, rather than setting
/// the ``EnvironmentValues/lineLimit`` value directly, as in the previous
/// example, you should instead use the ``View/lineLimit(_:)`` modifier:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             Text("This is some long, multiline text ðŸ’¬, that just keeps going")
///                 .frame(width: 200)
///                 .lineLimit(2)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A white view containing text with a small frame width and a line limit of two; the text displays as "This is some long,\n multiline text ðŸ’¬, that ju...".](enviornmentvalues-1.png)
///
/// In some cases, using a dedicated view modifier provides additional
/// functionality. For example, you must use the
/// ``View/preferredColorScheme(_:)`` modifier rather than setting
/// ``EnvironmentValues/colorScheme`` directly to ensure that the new
/// value propagates up to the presenting container when presenting a view
/// like a popover:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         @State var isPopped = false
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Tap me for dark mode! ðŸŒšðŸŒ™") { isPopped = true }
///                 .popover(isPresented: $isPopped) {
///                     Text("This is some dark ðŸŒ ðŸŒ‰ðŸŒŒ text")
///                         .preferredColorScheme(.dark)
///                 }
///         }
///     }

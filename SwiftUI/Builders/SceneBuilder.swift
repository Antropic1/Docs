/// A property wrapper that lets you build scenes declaratively.
///
/// ``SceneBuilder`` is used primary in the ``App`` structure in SwiftUI to let you create
/// your app's scenes by just listing them out in a trailing closure.
/// It's a **property wrapper** applied to function parameter.
/// Usually, it's just working behind the scenes, so you don't have to
/// worry about it.
///
/// (A scene builder is just specific type of
/// [result builder](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html#ID630)
/// that you can use with ``Scene``s. Check out that link to learn
/// more about using these to write clean code.)
///
/// ### Using a ``SceneBuilder`` as a trailing closure
///
/// ``SceneBuilder`` works behind the scenes of many common SwiftUI
/// scenes - like ``WindowGroup`` and ``Settings``. For example, here
/// is the declaration of ``Group``'s initializer:
///
/// ```
/// public init(@SceneBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///     // Implementation here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since that parameter is a ``SceneBuilder``, you can easily create
/// a ``Group`` by passing it a [trailing closure](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#ID102)
/// stacking views:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct SampleApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         Group {
///             WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///                 Text("I'm in the group üòÅ")
///             }
///             WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///                 Text("Me too ü•Ç")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a ``SceneBuilder`` as a function
///
/// You can also use ``SceneBuilder`` as a function. Just tag your
/// function with `@SceneBuilder`, and use it just like you would with a
/// trailing closure:
///
/// ```
/// @main
/// struct SampleApp: App {
///     var body: some Scene {
///         Group(content: contentBuilder)
///     }
///
///     @SceneBuilder
///     func contentBuilder() -> some Scene {
///         WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///             Text("I'm in the group üòÅ")
///         }
///         WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///             Text("Me too ü•Ç")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a `SceneBuilder` in your own ``Scene``s
///
/// Exactly like ``Group``, you can also use `ScebeBuilder`s in your own custom
/// scenes. Just tag the parameter of your ``Scene``'s initializer with
/// `@SceneBuilder`, and anyone using your scene will be able to easily
/// pass you views just by listing them.
///
/// In the example below, we use this technique to create a special
/// type of ``Group`` that adds command-P to print bananas to everything.
/// Note that ``SceneBuilder``s
/// are actually functions, so in order to get the content they contain,
/// you have to call the function. Below, this is done with `content()`.
///
/// ```
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         BananaPrintingGroup {
///             WindowGroup(id: "a") {
///                 Text("I print üçå")
///             }
///             WindowGroup(id: "b") {
///                 Text("Hey same üçåüçåüçå")
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct BananaPrintingGroup<Content>: Scene where Content: Scene {
///     var scenes: Content
///
///     init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
///         self.scenes = content()
///     }
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Group {
///             views.commands { PrintCommand() }
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct PrintCommand: Commands {
///     var body: some Commands {
///         CommandMenu("Print") {
///             Button("Print", action: { print("üçå") })
///                 .keyboardShortcut(KeyboardShortcut(KeyEquivalent("p"), modifiers: [.command]))
///         }
///     }
/// }

/// A structure which defines the placement of a toolbar item.
///
/// There are two types of placements:
/// - Semantic placements, such as `.principal` and `.navigation`,
/// which denote the intent of the item being added.
/// SwiftUI will determine the appropriate placement for the item
/// based on this intent, as well as the current platform.
/// - Positional placements, such as `.navigationBarLeading`,
/// which denote a precise placement for the item,
/// usually for a particular platform.
///
/// Toolbar placements are used with the ``ToolbarItem`` when defining a toolbar.
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// struct ExampleView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Text("üçåüçå")
///             .toolbar {
///                 ToolbarItem(placement: .bottomBar) {
///                     Button("Bottom bar button") { }
///                 }
///             }
///     }

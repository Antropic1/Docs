/// A 2D shape that you can use when drawing a view.
///
/// This procol inherits from the ``View`` protocol, so all shapes can be
/// used just like any other view. However, there are many default methods
/// that shapes have which views do not.
///
/// ### Using a pre-defined shape
///
/// In addition to the ability to create your own shape, there are also
/// many pre-defined shapes for you to use:
/// 1. ``Capsule``
/// 2. ``Circle``
/// 3. ``ContainerRelativeShape``
/// 4. ``Ellipse``
/// 5. ``Path``
/// 6. ``Rectangle``
/// 7. ``RoundedRectangle``
///
/// Example usage would look like this:
///
/// ```
/// struct PillView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         Capsule()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A screenshot displaying a solid black capsule occupying most of the screen
/// space. Here, a predefined shape is used.](D07AE93B-5C76-4604-B601-456F32FBE16C.png)
///
/// Check out these shapes directly for more info on how to use them.
///
/// ### Creating your own shape
///
/// The only requirement of conforming to the shape protocol is implementing
/// the ``Shape/path(in:)`` method. This method passes in the shape's
/// bounding rectangle, and expects a ``Path`` object in return.
///
/// The most simple example of creating your own shape is a rectangle
/// that looks like this:
///
/// ```
/// struct SimplestShapeView: View {
///     var body: some View {
///         RectangleShape()
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct RectangleShape: Shape {
///     func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
///         return Path(rect)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A screenshot displaying a solid black rectangle taking up the entirety of
/// the screen space besides the safe areas. The rectangle is created using
/// the path method.](09FB69B8-A5EF-4E46-9B27-4B59DF735287.png)
///
/// For more info on how to create a path from a bounding rectangle,
/// check out the ``Path`` structure.
///
/// - Note: In general, while view modifiers can be applied to shapes, note that
/// applying a view modifier will return a ``View`` rather than a shape.
/// Whenever possible, try to use shape modifiers instead of
/// view modifiers to accomplish the same tasks with your shapes.

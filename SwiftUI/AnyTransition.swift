/// A transition to use for animating a view on and off the screen.
///
/// Use this structure along with the ``View/transition(_:)``
/// view modifier to animate the way a ``View`` comes onto and leaves the
/// screen.
///
/// Examples of transitions include:
/// - ``AnyTransition/scale``
/// - ``AnyTransition/opacity`` (default)
/// - ``AnyTransition/slide``
/// - etc.
///
/// A transition is only one half of animating a view. You also must specify
/// a timing curve, (somewhat confusingly) called an "animation."
/// See ``Animation`` for more info on creating one of these timing curves.
///
/// ### Creating a transition
///
/// The easiest way to creat a transition is using one of
/// the many pre-made static members available in `AnyTransition`.
/// See the sliding banana example at the bottom of this page.
///
/// You can also create your own static members by extending this
/// struct.
///
/// ```
/// extension AnyTransition {
///     static var slideAndFade: AnyTransition {
///         return AnyTransition.slide.combined(with: .opacity)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using a transition
///
/// Transitions are most often used by attaching them to views that have
/// "if" statements on them.
///
/// As long as a timing curve (``Animation``) is specified, whenever the
/// view is added to or removed from the screen, it will do so with
/// the specified transition.
///
/// There are many ways to add an animation to the transition:
/// - Using ``withAnimation(_:_:)``
/// - Using `AnyTransition`'s own ``AnyTransition/animation(_:)`` modifier.
/// - Using ``View``'s ``View/animation(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// The following example applies the ``AnyTransition/slide`` transition:
///
/// ```
/// struct TransitioningBananaView: View {
///     @State var showBanana = true
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Button("Slide the banana ‚û°Ô∏è") {
///             withAnimation { showBanana.toggle() }
///         }
///         if showBanana {
///             Text("üçå")
///                 .transition(.slide)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![A gif displaying a view containing a button that reads "Slide the banana
/// ‚û°Ô∏è" that triggers the slide transition of the text view "üçå" when pressed;
/// the "üçå" slides down from beneath the button, displacing it until it slides
/// up again on the other side.](any-transition-using-ex.gif)
///
/// - Note: By default, views transition using ``AnyTransition/opacity``.
